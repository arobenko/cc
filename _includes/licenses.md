source code is available for anyone to use as long as the derivative work
remains open source with compatible license. **Download** and **try** it! 
If it works as expected and commercial closed source license is required for the final
product, please refer to the prices below.

Every license is 
- nonexclusive
- not-transferable
- irrevocable 
- **NOT** locked to the specific version of the 
[COMMS library](https://github.com/arobenko/comms_champion#comms-library)
(upgrade and downgrade as you will)
- royalty-free (pay only once for the right to use in closed source 
products).

Also all the licenses are upgradeable. At first, it is recommended to obtain
the **Evaluation** license for free. If it works for you and you would like to use it
again, pay $500 and get additional **Application** license. In case you need
a third license for the same product, pay $500 more (totals to $1000 payment altogether) and
get the **Product** license. If you start development of the next generation 
product within the same product line, pay $500 more to get **Product-Line** 
license (totals to $1500 payment altogether), and so on.
